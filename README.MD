### A simple Discord bot to randomly generate ability scores for D&D 5e.

It rolls 4d6, dropping the lowest die, 6 times, and sums up their
point buy costs.

---

The costs need some extrapolation, since the usual Point Buy system
only allows values from 8 to 15, so this bot uses custom rules
from [this popular Point Buy calculator](http://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html).
